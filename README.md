- Signing a message is a cryptographic measure to prove your ownership of your address via the wallet (and the associated private key). 
- You sign message and the wallet returns a so-called "signature". You copy this signature (a long string of numbers and letters) and paste it into the input field. This proves you are the owner of the relevant address.
